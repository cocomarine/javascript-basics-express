# JavaScript Basics in Express

Creating a Web API using Express that exposes the JavaScript functions previously solved, the JavaScript Basics (https://github.com/cocomarine/javascript-basics).

## Getting started

Ensure your Visual Studio Code application is up to date, and that you have the [ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) installed and enabled.

Run the commands below inside your `Projects` folder.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:MCRcodes/javascript-basics-express.git
cd your-project-folder-name
npm install
```

## Copy over JavaScript Basics code

This exercise makes use of the previous `javascript-basics` code (https://github.com/cocomarine/javascript-basics). Copy the files from that project's `src/` folder into a new `lib/` directory in this repository's `src` directory. You should end up with the following file structure in this project:

```
src
├── app.js
└── lib
    ├── arrays.js
    ├── booleans.js
    ├── numbers.js
    ├── objects.js
    └── strings.js
```

## Running tests

You can run tests with the `npm test` command.
